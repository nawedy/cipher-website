## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables needed across all divisions
CREATE TABLE divisions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  color_primary VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
  color_secondary VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
  domain VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  division_id UUID REFERENCES divisions(id),
  name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price_monthly INTEGER, -- in cents
  price_yearly INTEGER,
  features JSONB,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  company_name VARCHAR(200),
  division_preferences TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(100),
  status VARCHAR(50),
  current_period_start TIMESTAMP,
  current_period_end TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Shared UI components structure
export interface DivisionTheme {
  primary: string;
  secondary: string;
  accent: string;
  background: string;
}

export interface DivisionConfig {
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  theme: DivisionTheme;
  domain?: string;
}

// Base layout component
export const DivisionLayout = ({
  division,
  children
}: {
  division: DivisionConfig;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen" style={{
      '--division-primary': division.theme.primary,
      '--division-secondary': division.theme.secondary
    }}>
      <DivisionHeader division={division} />
      <main>{children}</main>
      <DivisionFooter division={division} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Revenue Implementation Priority

**Month 1-2: Foundation Revenue**
- Strategy consultation bookings
- DigitalWorks campaign management contracts

**Month 3-4: Product Revenue**
- Studio web development templates
- AI API subscriptions

**Month 5-6: Marketplace Revenue**
- Cross-division product bundles
- Enterprise licensing deals

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Monorepo Complexity**: Start simple, add optimization later
- **Cross-Division Data**: Use strict TypeScript interfaces
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading and code splitting from day 1

### Business Risks
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to MVP for each division
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus on 2-3 divisions initially
- **Market Validation**: Launch products with free tiers first

### Resource Allocation

**Full-Time Requirements:**
- 1 Frontend Developer (React/TypeScript)
- 1 Backend Developer (Node.js/Supabase)
- 1 Designer (UI/UX + Brand)
- 1 Product Manager (You)

**Part-Time/Contract:**
- DevOps Engineer (deployment setup)
- Content Writer (division-specific content)
- QA Tester (cross-browser testing)
